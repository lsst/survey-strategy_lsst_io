.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
    - If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _SCOC-process:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

About the SCOC
##############

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

The process of designing the LSST survey strategy is a partnership between the project
and the community, guided by the community representatives on the SCOC.

* `Charge to the Survey Cadence Optimization Committee <https://rtn-089.lsst.io/>`_
* `Current members list <https://rubinobservatory.org/for-scientists/committees-teams/scoc>`_

The SCOC remains a standing committee into Rubin Operations and will continue to meet regularly.
The SCOC will receive quarterly reports on survey progress and provide recommendations on strategic updates for the survey strategy,
whether these are responses to changes in scientific priorities or observatory capabilities.
The SCOC may hold calls for wider community input periodically, or establish task forces to investigate specific choices.

The SCOC provides recommendations to the Rubin Director of Operations, informed by simulations and evaluations generated by the Survey Strategy
Team and the Survey Evaluation Working Group (SEWG).
