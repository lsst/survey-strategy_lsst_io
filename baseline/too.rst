.. Review the README on instructions to contribute.
.. Review the style guide to keep a consistent approach to the documentation.
.. Static objects, such as figures, should be stored in the _static directory. Review the _static/README on instructions to contribute.
.. Do not remove the comments that describe each section. They are included to provide guidance to contributors.
.. Do not remove other content provided in the templates, such as a section. Instead, comment out the content and include comments to explain the situation. For example:
    - If a section within the template is not needed, comment out the section title and label reference. Do not delete the expected section title, reference or related comments provided from the template.
    - If a file cannot include a title (surrounded by ampersands (#)), comment out the title from the template and include a comment explaining why this is implemented (in addition to applying the ``title`` directive).

.. This is the label that can be used for cross referencing this file.
.. Recommended title label format is "Directory Name"-"Title Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. _Baseline-ToO:
.. Each section should include a label for cross referencing to a given area.
.. Recommended format for all labels is "Title Name"-"Section Name" -- Spaces should be replaced by hyphens.
.. To reference a label that isn't associated with an reST object such as a title or figure, you must include the link and explicit title using the syntax :ref:`link text <label-name>`.
.. A warning will alert you of identical labels during the linkcheck process.

Target of Opportunity (ToO)

.. This section should provide a brief, top-level description of the page.

The SCOC has recommended that up to 3% of the survey time be available for
Target of Opportunity observations (`PSTN-055 <https://pstn-055.lsst.io>`_).
Details of what ToOs could entail, how they would be triggered, and how they should
be observed are still under discussion.

The `Rubin ToO 2024 <https://lssttooworkshop.github.io>`_ workshop provided an
opportunity to more fully define the requirements for ToO observations. The
`report <https://lssttooworkshop.github.io/images/Rubin_2024_ToO_workshop_final_report.pdf>`_
from this workshop is available now.

Details of how to implement ToO followup within Rubin are still under discussion.
